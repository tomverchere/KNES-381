  <tr>
<th style="width: 300px;"><p>VO&#x0307;<sub>2max</sub>, also referred to as maximal oxygen consumption, indicates the maximum amount of oxygen that one can utilize during intense or maximal exercise. This measurement is frequently considered as being the best indicator of cardiovascular fitness and aerobic endurance. The more oxygen a person can use during high level exercise, the more energy a person can produce. This test is the gold standard for determining cardio-respiratory fitness because the muscles need oxygen for prolonged aerobic exercise, and the heart must pump adequate amounts of blood through the circulation to meet the demands of aerobic exercise.</p></th>
